This creates a sense of intimacy and direct engagement with the viewer, making the human figure the primary focus against the background.\n\nIn **Image 2**, the person is depicted on a much **smaller, environmental scale**. They occupy only a small fraction of the overall frame, positioned within a vast landscape or architectural setting. This scale emphasizes the relationship between the individual and their surroundings, often evoking feelings of solitude, insignificance, or wonder in the face of a large environment.\n\n**Conclusion:** The person in **Image 1 is significantly larger** in relative scale, while the person in **Image 2 is much smaller** within the frame.",
