It is low to the ground and has four thin legs. While it could be a small child's chair, its height and flat top make it just as likely to be a **small stool or a side table**.\n\nBecause the backrest is not clearly visible on the smaller piece, it is more accurate to say there is **one confirmed chair** (the red one) and one piece of small furniture that is either a stool or a small table.",

Its solid, blocky shape and flat top are more consistent with a **small nightstand, a storage bin, or a side cabinet** rather than a chair facing away.\n\nIf we were to count every piece of furniture in that corner, there are three distinct items. However, based on visual evidence, only the **red spindle-back item** can be definitively confirmed as a **chair**.
