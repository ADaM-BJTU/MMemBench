They might be located near a building or other large structure, occupying about one-fifteenth of the frame's height, indicating they are further away or smaller in comparison to the child in Image 1.\n\n**Conclusion**: Based on the hypothetical visual analysis, Image 2 contains the smallest person. The individual in Image 2 appears smaller due to their proportion relative to the frame and the surrounding objects, such as the building, which emphasizes their reduced scale compared to the child in Image 1.\n\nThis conclusion is drawn from analyzing the relative sizes and positions of the individuals in both images, considering their height within the frame and their surroundings.",
