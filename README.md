# MMemBench
MMemBench aims at tackling Global Vision Cheating and State Management ignorance in static VQA. We introduce a Dynamic Paradigm: a User Simulator with an Explicit Action Space that probes VLMs like a detective.  Evaluate Retrieval, Reasoning, and Robustness through interaction, not just snapshots.
